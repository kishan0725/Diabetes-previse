# Diabetes-previse

Predict whether a person will have diabetes or not based on his/her Glucose,Age,BMI,Blood Pressure,etc.

## Algorithm:
KNN Algorithm(K Nearest Neighbors)

### About Dataset:
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

#### Columns:

    1.Pregnancies- Number of times pregnant
    2.Glucose- Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
    3.BloodPressure- Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
    4.SkinThickness- Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
    5.Insulin- 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
    6.BMI- Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
    7.DiabetesPedigreeFunction- a synthesis of the diabetes mellitus history in relatives and the genetic relationship of those relatives to the subject.
    8.Age- Age (years)
    9.Outcome- Class variable (0 or 1)
